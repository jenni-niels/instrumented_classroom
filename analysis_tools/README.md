## Instrumented Classroom Analysis Tools

This project exhibits the demo tool `transitions.py`, which analysis a transcript
for shifts in modes of group learning by looking for keywords and phrases that
signal a transition in group state.

It takes two inputs: a transcript generated from the instrumented classroom
system and a json object represented the states it is going to look for, of which
`states.json` is an example.
